# Introduction:

The Weeping Angels are a fictional monster originating from the popular British TV show, Dr Who, where these terrifying status monsters are a staple enemy. Our groupâ€™s goal was to recreate these monsters with robots using ROS. So how do Weeping Angels work? Weeping Angels in Dr Who are extremely fast beings that chase after people, but they can only move if no one is looking at them. Our robot is designed to do the same thing, follow a person and stop when they look at the robot. To achieve this end, we used person and facial recognition to track humans with a camera, and identify when someone is looking at the robot.
