# Limitations

For the most part the final product presented operates exactly how we expected it. Improvements can be achieved through further calibration of the Object avoidance code, and a potential addition of a person location memory, so that if the robot loses sight of the person, it can smartly relocate them.

However, the project faces major hardware limitations. Though the person/facial recognition and object avoidance codes work as intended, the runtime of the person/facial recognition code causes significant lag in the simulation. As of now, the only way for us to gather reasonable results is to slow down the simulation to 1% speed compared to real time. Though this is mostly a hardware limitation, as testing of the code on computers outside of the virtual environment for which we simulated on, garners us equal, if not better, results in real time as opposed to .1% time.
